# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm at the beginning of my journey in DA/DS with over a year of programming experience. I have successfully mastered Python and SQL. I have worked at Yandex and TerraLink, as intern DS for these companies and handling other equally interesting tasks; obtained high organization & communication skills.
